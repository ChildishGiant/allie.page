I've been dabbling in software development since 2014, starting
with simple websites using `html` and `css`, then moving onto `js`. I've also used `python` in many
projects and recently have been using `vala` for my [Mixer](/projects/mixer) project. More recently
I've been getting more directly involved politically after years of discontent with how things are
going. I've been supporting Just Stop Oil by marching and redecorating the Canary Warf HQ of the
horrendous EACOP pipeline. I'm just one person but I'm doing what I can.
