### [tic-80-palette-editor](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/tic-80-palette-editor)
A tool for editing the colour palette of the TIC-80 fantasy console without having to directly change the hex values.

### [colour-blending](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/colour-blending)
A tool I made for my brother so he can preview what different blend modes will look like when making maps.

### [dodie-hangman](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/dodie-hangman)
In 2021 [Dodie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodie) released a video with a hangman puzzle in it. This is a script to
attempt to solve the puzzle before all the letters were shown (we succeeded!)

### [esbuild-plugin-hjson](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/esbuild-plugin-hjson)
A pluging for the [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) Javascript bundler to allow it to load [hjson](https://hjson.github.io/) files.

### [braille-typer](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/braille-typer)
A site that lets you input text from braille and see what it says.

### [human-sort](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/human-sort)
This is a utility for sorting lists by making lots of smaller, easier decisions. Pretty sure it could be a lot more efficient but not sure how to go about doing that.

### [chrono-countdown](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/chrono-countdown)
There used to be a website called [chrono.gg](https://www.chrono.gg) and they used to offer free games with a currency you could earn by visiting the store every day. This site counted down till the free games were rotated to new ones.

### [pixels-to-svg](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/pixels-to-svg)
Originally made to facilitate getting logos for Cloverleaf, this turns pixel art into SVGs.

### [inset](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/inset)
The start of an icon pack for Android that I never fully committed to finishing.

### [elementary-dark-plank](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/elementary-dark-plank)
A theme for the "plank" dock elementary uses, to make it match with the dark system theme. I think this is no longer necessary but I don't use elementary any more so who knows Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

### [paladins-randomiser](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/paladins-randomiser)
A randomiser for picking random characters when playing the game [Paladins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paladins_(video_game)). I haven't played the game in years sadly as they [don't want to support linux](https://areweanticheatyet.com/game/paladins) ðŸ˜¢

### [painterly](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/painterly)
A game I made in an attempt to keep myself sane while in hospital. I had no internet so it was more of a challenge than I was used to but I eventually got some downloaded docs and made something vaguely entertaining at the end of it all.

### [emoji-builder](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/emoji-builder)
Lots of emoji are made by combining invisible characters, I thought I'd make a site that makes playing around with that easier. Very much a prototype.
