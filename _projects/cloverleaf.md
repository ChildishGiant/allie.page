{{site.title}}

Cloverleaf is my pet project and certainly the project I've sunk the most time and effort into. Not only with the
actual web dev but branding and considering each feature. The website itself is, however, PWA compliant so can
*magically* act as if it were a native app on different operating systems. Sadly that's just in theory and in reality,
non-native apps stick out like a sore thumb as of recently so I've been putting off completely remaking it.
So far I've split	it off into an NPM module so it can be integrated into different environments (so far just web and a browser extenstion).
